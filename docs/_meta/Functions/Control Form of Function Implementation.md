# Control Form of Function Implementation

As important as they are, function implementations are very simple to write.

```markdown
identifier paramSeq = body
```

The `identifier` component represents the name of a function.

The `paramSeq` component represents a fix-length space-separated parameter sequence.

The `body` component represents an expression which is evaluated when the function is called.
