# Operator-associativity

The associativity is important when evaluating two operators of the same precedence.

There are three associativities:
- `infix` for non-associative operators,
- `infixl` for left-associative operators, and
- `infixr` for right-associative operators.

The associativity of an operator is `infixl` by default.
