{"/":{"title":"Cleanpedia","content":"\n## Introduction\n\nThe motivation of this reference is to create an accessible, concise, and clear documentation for those who are seeking to learn CLEAN.\n\nThe same information can be found on:\n\n- [Cloogle](https://cloogle.org/) which is the language’s search engine, and\n- [language report](https://cloogle.org/doc/) which describes the syntax and BNF of Clean.\n\nHowever, this documentation is not official.\nTerminologies and explanations may not be entirely true to the references used.\n\nIn addition, the language report, which was the primary source of this documentation, was written for the version 2.0 of CLEAN.\n\nIf you notice any mistake or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to contact me through the following channels:\n\n- Email: [b9xp3x@inf.elte.hu](mailto:b9xp3x@inf.elte.hu)\n- Instagram: [@\\_kornthana](https://www.instagram.com/_kornthana/)\n- Telegram channel:

a Function](function/Defining%20a%20Function.md)\n\n---\n\n## Built-In Types\n\nTypes like integers, Booleans, characters, real numbers, lists, tuples, and arrays are frequently used.\nThey have been predefined for reasons of efficiency and convenience.\n\nThere are four built-in primitive types:\n- integer type,\n- real number type,\n- Boolean type, and\n- character type.\n\nThere are three built-in structured types:\n- list type,\n- array type, and\n- tuple type.\n\n### Integers\n\n#### Constructing Integers\n\nThere are three methods to construct integer literals;\n- from decimal notation,\n- from octal notation, and\n- from hexadecimal notation.\n\nInteger literals constructed with decimal notation may be written as follows.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n-13\n 0\n 13\n```\n\nInteger literals constructed with octal notation may be written by prefixing octal digits with `0`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n-015  // decimal -13\n 0\n 015  // decimal  13\n```\n\nIntegers literals constructed with hexadecimal notation may be written by prefixing hexadecimal digits with `0x`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n-0xD  // decimal -13\n 0\n 0xd  // decimal  13\n```\n\n#### Typing Integers\n\nAn expression of integer type may be explicitly typed using `Int`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nexpr :: Int\nexpr =  1 + 1\n```\n\n#### Integer Operators And Functions\n\nInteger operations and functions are discussed in more details on [Appendix A: StdInt](appendix-a/stdint).\n\n### Real Numbers\n\n#### Constructing Real Number\n\nThere are two methods to construct real number literals;\n- from decimal notation, and\n- from scientific notation.\n\nReal number literals constructed with decimal notation may be written as follows.\n\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n-1.3\n 0.0\n 1.3\n```\n\nReal number literals constructed with scientific notation may be written using `..E..` form.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n-13E-2  // -0.13\n 0E0    //  0\n 13E-2  //  0.13\n```\n\nWhen constructing a real number literal with scientific notation, the expression may result in an integer instead of a real number.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n13E2  // 1300\n```\n\n#### Typing Real Numbers\n\nAn expression of real number type may be explicitly typed using `Real`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nexpr :: Real\nexpr =  1.0 + 1.0\n```\n\n#### Real Number Operators And Functions\n\nReal number operations and functions are discussed in more details on [Appendix A: StdReal](appendix-a/stdreal).\n\n### Booleans\n\n#### Constructing Booleans\n\nThere are two methods to construct Boolean literals.\nEach constructor represent a Boolean value.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nTrue\nFalse\n```\n\n#### Typing Booleans\n\nAn expression of Boolean type may be explicitly typed using `Bool`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nexpr :: Bool\nexpr =  1 == 1\n```\n\n#### Boolean Operations and Functions\n\nBoolean operations and functions are discussed in more details on [Appendix A: StdBool](appendix-a/stdbool).\n\n### Characters\n\n#### Constructing Characters\n\nA character may be constructed by placing one character inside a pair of single quotation marks (`'..'`).\n\nCharacters constructed in the same way.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n'a'\n'9'\n'Z'\n'+'\n```\n\n#### Typing Characters\n\nAn expression of character type may be explicitly typed using `Char`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nexpr :: Char\nexpr =  'a'\n```\n\n#### Character Operations And Functions\n\nCharacter operations and functions are discussed in more details on [Appendix A: StdChar](appendix-a/stdchar).\n\n### Lists\n\n**Type annotation**:\n`[Int]`,\n`[Char]`,\n`[T]`,\net cetera.\n\n#### Constructing Lists\n\nA list can be constructed in many ways, but there are three primary methods.\nThe simplest way to construct a list is to explicitly write elements between a pair of square brackets (`[..]`).\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1]\n```\n\nElements are comma (`,`) separated.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nA list may be appended to the end of another list using colon (`:`).\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1 : [2, 3]]\n```\n\nThe outer list (`[1 : ..]`) is constructed by appending the inner list (`[2, 3]`) to the end.\n\nAs a result, this method of list construction has a wide varieties which can be written.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1 : [2 : [3 : []]]]\n[1, 2 : [3]]\n[1, 2, 3 : []]\n```\n\nSecondly, a list may be implicitly constructed with `dot-dot` expression, and a control expression may be written as follows.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[initial..]\n```\n\nAn infinite list is generated from `initial`, which represents the starting value, subsequent elements are incremented by one.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1..]  // [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]\n```\n\nTo create a finite list, an `end` value may be specified.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[initial..end]\n```\n\nBy adding `end`, elements are generated only up to `end` it self.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1..5]  // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nIn addition, `next` value may be specified to change how subsequent elements are generated.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[initial, next..end]\n```\n\nEach step is computed from `next - initial`.\nIf the next element is strictly greater than `end`, it will not be included.\nIt is possible to generate a list which is in descending order.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1, 3..9]  // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]\n[5, 4..1]  // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nBy omitting `end`, an infinite list with step may be generated.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[initial, next..]\n```\n\nThe expression results in an infinite list.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[1, 3..]  // [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...]\n[5, 4..]  // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ...]\n```\n\nIt should be noted that `dot-dot` expressions requires `StdEnum` module.\n\nAnd lastly, a list may be constructed with comprehension.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n// extract from a list\n[el \\\\ el \u003c- list]\n\n// extract from an array\n[el \\\\ el \u003c-: array]\n\n// cartesian product\n[(x, y) \\\\ x \u003c- xs , y \u003c- ys]\n\n// pair-wise zip\n[(x, y) \\\\ x \u003c- xs \u0026 y \u003c- ys]\n\n// same as filter\n[x \\\\ x \u003c- xs | P x]\n\n// nested\n[(x, y) \\\\ x \u003c- xs, y \u003c- [1..x]]\n```\n\nA special notation for constructing a list of characters is also provided:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n['a', 'b', 'c']\n['abc']\n['ab','c']\n```\n\nA list may contain an infinite number of elements, but elements must have the same type.\n\nMore information about built-in operations and functions on lists can be found on:\n\n- [Appendix A: StdCharList](appendix-a/stdcharlist),\n- [Appendix A: StdList](appendix-a/stdlist), and\n- [Appendix A: StdOrdList](appendix-a/stdordlist).\n\n**List patterns**\n\nLists can be specified as patterns as follow:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFst :: [T]       -\u003e T\ngetFst    [x, y, z] =  x\n\ngetSnd :: [T]       -\u003e T\ngetSnd    [x, y, z] =  y\n\ngetThd :: [T]       -\u003e T\ngetThd    [x, y, z] =  z\n```\n\nThe results of these function calls are as expected:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFst [1, 2, 3]  // 1\ngetSnd [1, 2, 3]  // 2\ngetThd [1, 2, 3]  // 3\n```\n\nHowever, they will result in a run-time error if it is invoked with a list which does not have exactly three elements.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFst [1]          // NOT OK :(\ngetSnd [1, 2]       // NOT OK :(\ngetThd [4, 3, 2, 1] // NOT OK :(\n```\n\nTo remedy this issue, an addition element should be introduce.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFstAny :: [T]     -\u003e T\ngetFstAny    [x : r] =  x\n\ngetSndAny :: [T]        -\u003e T\ngetSndAny    [x, y : r] =  y\n\ngetThdAny :: [T]           -\u003e T\ngetThdAny    [x, y, z : r] =  z\n```\n\nThe right-hand side of colon ($:$) matches with any number of elements, including zero.\nIt is worth noting that $r$ is always a list.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFstAny [1]           // x = 1\n                        // r = []\n\ngetFstAny [1, 2]        // x = 1\n                        // r = [2]\n\ngetFstAny [4, 3, 2, 1]  // x = 4\n                        // r = [3, 2, 1]\n```\n\nHowever, the second function still requires the list to have at least two elements.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetSndAny [1]           // NOT OK :(\n\ngetSndAny [1, 2]        // x = 1\n                        // y = 2\n                        // r = []\n\ngetSndAny [4, 3 ,2 ,1]  // x = 4\n                        // y = 3\n                        // r = [2, 1]\n```\n\nSimilarly, the third function requires a list with at least three elements.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetThdAny [1]           // NOT OK :(\n\ngetThdAny [1, 2]        // NOT OK :(\n\ngetThdAny [4, 3, 2, 1]  // x = 4\n                        // y = 3\n                        // z = 2\n                        // r = [1]\n```\n\n### Tuples\n\n#### Defining A Tuple\n\n**Type annotation**:\n$(\\textbf{T},\\ \\textbf{K})$,\n$(\\textbf{T},\\ \\textbf{K},\\ \\textbf{V})$,\n$(\\textbf{T},\\ \\textbf{K},\\ \\textbf{V},\\ \\textbf{E})$\net cetera.\n\nA tuple contains finite number of elements.\nElements do not have to be the same type.\nEvery type appears in a tuple must be specified, and singleton tuples are not allowed.\n\n**Constructors**\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nA :: (Int, Char)\nA =  (49, '1')\n\nB :: (Real, Bool, String)\nB =  (0.2, False, \"Hi\")\n\nC :: (Int)\nC =  (2, 6)  // NOT OK should be (Int, Int)\n\nD :: (Int)\nD =  (2)     // NOT OK\n```\n\nMore information about built-in operations and functions on lists can be found on:\n\n- [Appendix A: StdTuple](appendix-a/stdtuple).\n\n#### Tuple Patterns\n\nTuples can be used as patterns in a similar way to lists.\nHowever, colon ($:$) is not allowed in tuple patterns.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFst :: (T, K, V) -\u003e T\ngetFst    (x, y, z) =  x\n\ngetSnd :: (T, K, V) -\u003e K\ngetSnd    (x, y, z) =  y\n\ngetThd :: (T, K, V) -\u003e V\ngetThd    (x, y, z) =  z\n```\n\nThe results of these function calls are as expected:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ngetFst (1, 'a', 1.0)  // 1\ngetSnd (1, 'a', 1.0)  // 'a'\ngetThd (1, 'a', 1.0)  // 1.0\n```\n\n### Arrays\n\n#### Defining An Array\n\n**Type annotation**:\n$\\{\\textbf{Int}\\}$,\n$\\{\\textbf{Char}\\}$,\n$\\{\\textbf{T}\\}$,\net cetera.\n\nAn array contains a finite number of elements.\nElements of an array have to be of the same type.\n\n**Constructors**\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4}\n{1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}\n\n\"abc\"\n// equivalent to\n// {'a', 'b', 'c'}\n```\n\nAn array can be constructed from comprehension by surrounding a comprehension with $\\{\\ldots\\}$.\n\nMore information about built-in operations and functions on lists can be found on:\n\n- [Appendix A: StdArray](appendix-a/stdarray), and\n- [Appendix A: StdString](appendix-a/stdstring).\n\n---\n\n## Defining New Types\n\nAs a strongly typed language, every object and function in CLEAN has a type.\nThe basic can be extended with algebraic types, record types, abstract types and synonym types.\n\nNew types can only be defined on the global level.\n\n### Algebraic Data Types\n\n#### Defining An Algebraic Data Type\n\nAn algebraic data type introduces a new data structure and a constructor.\n\nIt has the following syntax.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] = [tConstructor]\n```\n\nAn algebraic data type can have multiple constructors.\nConstructors defined in the same global scope must have names.\nConstructors must be separated by a vertical bar ($|$).\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] = [tConstructorA] | [tConstructorB] | [tConstructorC]\n```\n\nFor readability, constructors may be placed on different lines.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] = [tConstructorA]\n           | [tConstructorB]\n           | [tConstructorC]\n```\n\nFor example, a basic algebraic type can be defined as follows.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Mood = Happy | Sad\n```\n\nConstructors also accept types as arguments, but they must be declared on the left-hand side.\nOnce declared, these generic types can be referred to by any of its constructors.\n\n```\n// language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] T K = [tConstructorA] T\n               | [tConstructorB] K\n               | [tConstructorC] T K\n```\n\nFor example, a binary tree, which is has a recursive structure can be defined as follows.\n\n```\n// language: Clean\n\n:: Tree = Branch Tree Tree\n        | Leaf\n```\n\nAn infix constructor is defined by surrounding its name with parentheses.\nThey must have an arity of two.\nThe precedence and fixity of an such constructor follows that of an operator, which is discussed in Chapter I.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] T K =  [tConstructorA]  T\n               |  [tConstructorB]  K\n               | ([tConstructorC]) T K\n\n:: [tName] T K =  [tConstructorA]  T\n               |  [tConstructorB]  K\n               | ([tConstructorC]) [fixity] [precedence] T K\n```\n\nFor example, the $\\text{Branch}$ constructor can be rewritten as an infix constructor.\n\n```\n// language: Clean\n\n:: TreeInfix = (/\\) infixr 0 Tree Tree\n             | Leaf\n```\n\nThe precedence and fixity of an infix constructor can be omitted.\nThe default precedence is $9$, and the default fixity is $\\textbf{infixl}$.\n\n```\n// language: Clean\n\n:: TreeInfix = (/\\) Tree Tree\n             | Leaf\n```\n\n#### Creating Objects Of Algebraic Data Types\n\nObjects of simple algebraic data types are created by invoking one of its constructors.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Mood = Sad | Happy\n\nA :: Mood\nA =  Happy\n\nB :: Mood\nB =  Sad\n```\n\nIf a constructor accepts arguments, it should be invoked with appropriate arguments.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Tree = Branch Tree Tree\n        | Leaf\n\nA :: Tree\nA =  Leaf\n\nB :: Tree\nB =  Branch Leaf Leaf\n\nC :: Tree\nC =  Branch Leaf (Branch Leaf Leaf)\n```\n\nInfix constructors behave in a similar way.\n\n```\n// language: Clean\n\n:: TreeInfix = (/\\) TreeInfix TreeInfix\n               | Leaf\n\nA :: TreeInfix\nA =  Leaf\n\nB :: TreeInfix\nB =  Leaf /\\ Leaf\n\nC :: TreeInfix\nC =  (/\\) Leaf Leaf\n\nD :: TreeInfix\nD =  Leaf /\\ (Leaf /\\ Leaf)\n```\n\n#### Algebraic Data Type Patterns\n\nTo use a algebraic data type as a pattern, use its constructors.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Mood = Sad | Happy\n\nisHappy :: Mood    -\u003e Bool\nisHappy    (Happy) =  True\nisHappy    _       =  False\n```\n\nWith the same process, complex algebraic data types can be used as patterns as well.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Tree = Branch Tree Tree\n        | Leaf\n\nisBranch :: Tree           -\u003e Bool\nisBranch    (Branch l r)   =  True\nisBranch    _              =  False\n\n:: TreeInfix = (/\\) TreeInfix TreeInfix\n               | Leaf\n\nisBranchInfix :: TreeInfix -\u003e Bool\nisBranchInfix   (l/\\r)     =  True\nisBranchInfix   _          =  False\n```\n\n### Record Types\n\nA record type is an algebraic data type in which exactly one constructor is defined.\nA field name is attached to each of the arguments of the constructor.\n\n#### Defining A Record Type\n\nA record type is a tuple-like algebraic data structure that has the advantage that its elements can be selected by field name rather than by position.\n\nA simple record type can be defined as follows.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] = { [fieldName] :: [fieldType] }\n```\n\nFields must be separated commas ($,$).\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] = { [fNameA] :: [fTypeA] , [fNameB] :: [fTypeB] , [fNameC] :: [fTypeC]  }\n```\n\nTo increase readability, fields can be placed on different lines.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] = { [fNameA] :: [fTypeA]\n             , [fNameB] :: [fTypeB]\n             , [fNameC] :: [fTypeC]\n             }\n```\n\nFor example, a record type for representing complex numbers can be defined as follows.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Complex = { re :: Real\n             , im :: Real\n             }\n```\n\n#### Creating Objects Of Record Types\n\nThe field names are case-sensitive, but the field order does not matter.\nEvery field of a record type must be given.\n\n```\n// Language\n\n:: Complex = { re :: Real\n             , im :: Real\n             }\n\nA :: Complex\nA =  { re = 1.0 , im = 0.0 }\n\nB :: Complex\nB =  { im = 1.0 , re = 0.0}\n```\n\nThe name of a record type can be added to the constructor.\nIn such a case, the type annotation can be omitted.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Point = { x :: Int\n           , y :: Int\n           }\n\n:: Position = { x :: Int\n              , y :: Int\n              }\n\n// A :: Point\n// A =  { x = 0 , y = 0 }\nA =  { Point | x = 0 , y = 0 }\n\n// B :: Position\n// B =  { x = 0 , y = 0 }\nB =  { Position | x = 0 , y = 0 }\n```\n\n**Record update**\n\nA new record object can be constructed from an existing one.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n{ [oldObject] \u0026 [fName] = [newValue] }\n```\n\nMultiple fields can be updated all at once.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n{ [oldObject] \u0026 [fNameA] = [newValueA] , [fNameB] = [newValueB] }\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: PosThree = { x :: Int\n              , y :: Int\n              , z :: Int\n              }\n\nA :: PosThree\nA =  { x = 0 , y = 0 , z = 0 }  // (PosThree 0 0 0)\n\nB :: PosThree\nB =  { A \u0026 x = 1 , y = 1 }      // (PosThree 1 1 0)\n```\n\n#### Record Type Patterns\n\nAn object of type record can be specified as pattern.\nNot every field must be used.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: PosThree = { x :: Int\n              , y :: Int\n              , z :: Int\n              }\n\nisZeroX :: PosThree -\u003e Bool\nisZeroX    { x=0 }  =  True\nisZeroX    _        =  False\n\nA :: PosThree\nA =  { x = 0 , y = 0 , z = 0 }\n\nisZeroX A  // True\n\nB :: PosThree\nB =  { A \u0026 x = 1 , y = 1 }\n\nisZeroX B  // False\n```\n\nAlternatively, record fields can be extracted without patterns.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: PosThree = { x :: Int\n              , y :: Int\n              , z :: Int\n              }\n\nisZeroY :: PosThree -\u003e Bool\nisZeroY    { y=r }    =  r == 0\n```\n\nIn the implementation above, the record field $y$ is extracted to $r$.\nIt can be used referred by the body.\n\nRecord fields can be extracted to an identifier of the same name.\n\n```\n:: PosThree = { x :: Int\n              , y :: Int\n              , z :: Int\n              }\n\nisZeroZ :: PosThree -\u003e Bool\nisZeroZ    { z }    =  z == 0\n```\n\nThe implementation above is equivalent to the following:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisZeroZ :: PosThree -\u003e Bool\nisZeroZ    { z=z }  =  z == 0\n```\n\n**Record field selection**\n\nThe value of a record field can be selected using dot operator ($.$).\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[recordObj].[fName]\n```\n\nFor example, a simple getter function on $\\textbf{Point}$ can be defined as follows.\n\n```\n:: Point = { x :: Int\n           , y :: Int\n           }\n\ngetX :: Point -\u003e Int\ngetX    p     =  p.x\n\nA :: Point\nA =  { x = 1 , y = 0 }\n\ngetX a  // 1\n```\n\n### Synonym Types\n\nSynonym types allow for an introduction of a new type name for an existing type.\n\n#### Defining A Synonym Type\n\nA simple synonym type has the follow syntax:\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] :== [existingType]\n```\n\nFor example, an array of characters can be viewed as a string.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: String :== {Char}\n```\n\nSynonym types also accept generic types as arguments.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: [tName] T K :== [existingType] T K\n```\n\nFor example, an arity-two operator can be shortened with a synonym type.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Op T :== T T -\u003e T\n\n// add :: Int Int -\u003e Int\nadd :: (Op Int)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Overloading\n\n### Overloaded Functions\n\nFunctions and operators are defined on built-in types.\nHowever, when interacting with custom data types, they do not have any defined function or operator.\n\nThat is, adding two objects of $\\textbf{Complex}$ type is not allowed.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n:: Complex = { re :: Real\n             , im :: Real\n             }\n\na :: Complex\na =  { re = 0.0 , im = 1.0 }\n\nb :: Complex\nb =  { re = 0.0 , im = 1.0 }\n\na + b  // NOT OK :(\n```\n\nThis happens because addition is not defined on $\\textbf{Complex}$ type.\n\nIn this case, addition can be overloaded on $\\textbf{Complex}$ type.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ninstance + Complex\nwhere\n    (+) x y = { Complex | re=(x.re + y.re) , im=(x.im + y.im)}\n\na + b  // (Complex 0.0 2.0)\n```\n\nOnly after overloading the addition operation on $\\textbf{Complex}$ that the addition is allowed.\nIn other word, the complier now knows the meaning of complex number addition.\n\nA list of functions and operations which can be overloaded can be found on [Appendix A: StdOverloaded](appendix-a/stdoverloaded).\n\n#### Defining An Overloaded Function Or Operator\n\nTo overload the built-in functions and operations, the general syntax is as follows.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ninstance [clsName] [typeVars]\nwhere\n    [fnImplementation]\n    [opImplementation]\n```\n\nFunctions and operators can be defined in terms of existing overloaded functions.\nThis is especially useful when dealing with generic types.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nincrement :: T -\u003e T\nincrement    x =  x + 1\n```\n\nIt is adding an object of type $\\textbf{T}$ and $1$ which is an integer.\nUnless the addition is instantiated for mentioned types, this implementation would not work as intended.\n\nOne way to ensure that it works for all type is to introduce class context.\n\n```\nincrement :: T -\u003e T | + T \u0026 one T\nincrement    x =  x + one\n```\n\nThe new implementation requires that the addition operation, as well as, $\\textbf{one}$ unit is defined on a generic type $\\textbf{T}$.\n\nIn this case, the function is defined in terms of an overloaded function and a unit.\n\nSuch declaration has the following syntax.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\n[fnName] :: [typeVars] -\u003e [typeVar] | [clsConstraints]\n```\n\nClass constraints are separated by ampersands ($\\\u0026$).\n\n### Classes\n\nA class gives name to a group of overloaded functions and operators.\nThese functions and operators are members of the class.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nclass Equal T\nwhere\n    (==) infixl 4 :: T T -\u003e Bool\n    (\u003c\u003e) infixl 4 :: T T -\u003e Bool\n```\n\nThe class $\\text{Eq}$ has two members.\nThey are equality and inequality operators.\n\nTo instantiate a class, all of its members must be implemented.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ninstance Equal Complex\nwhere\n    (==) x y = (x.re == y.re) \u0026\u0026 (x.im == y.im)\n    (\u003c\u003e) x y = (x.re \u003c\u003e y.re) || (x.im \u003c\u003e y.im))\n```\n\nA list of classes can be found on [Appendix A: StdClass](appendix-a/stdclass).\n\n#### Defining A Class\n\nAs shown above, a class simple provides a name to collection of logically-linked functions and operations.\n\nIt can be defined with the following syntax.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nclass [clsName] [typeVars]\nwhere\n    [fnDeclaration]\n    [opDeclaration]\n```\n\nType variables declared can be referred to by all of its member, but they must be given as arguments when the class is instantiated.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nclass MinMaxC T K\nwhere\n    minC :: T T -\u003e K\n    maxC :: T T -\u003e K\n\ninstance MinMax Real Int\nwhere\n    minC x y = toInt (min x y)\n    maxC x y = toInt (max x y)\n```","lastmodified":"2023-06-19T20:30:36.495859819Z","tags":null},"/Constants":{"title":"","content":"There are two distinct types of constants; constant expressions and constant

integer $n$, the last digit is placed on the end of a list.\nTo get the last digit of $n$, we take advantage of the $\\text{mod}$ operation. \n\nBefore the next iteration, $n$ is divided by $10$, this step removes the last digit of $n$ since it has already been placed in the list.\n\n$\\text{abs}$ expands domain from $[0,\\ \\infty)$ to $(-\\infty,\\ \\infty)$.\n\n### List comprehension\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\ntoDigits :: Int -\u003e [Int]\ntoDigits    n   =  [(toInt d) - 48 \\\\ d \u003c-: (toString n)]\n```\n\n**Conversion  pathway**\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Int}\\rightarrow\\text{String}\\rightarrow\\text{Char}\\rightarrow\\text{Int}\\rightarrow[\\text{Int}]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n**Explanation**:\n\nSince arrays can be freely converted to lists and vice versa, we can convert $n$ to an array.\n\nIn this case, $n$ is converted into an array of $\\text{Char}$.\n$\\text{toInt}$ then converts each digit of $n$ to $\\text{Int}$.\n\nHowever, the $\\text{Char}\\rightarrow\\text{Int}$ conversions are ASCII based.\nThat is \n- character $1$ converts to integer value $49$, \n- character $2$ converts to integer value $50$, and so on.\n\nIn the final step, an offset value of $48$ is subtracted from the result.\n\n\n[Back to top](#)\n\n---\n\n## Computing divisors of an integer\n\n**Signature**:

generated.\nIt contains integers in $[1,\\ \\lvert{n}\\rvert]$ interval.\n\nThe helper function $\\text{isDivisible}$ determines which integer will be placed in the list, and which integer will be discarded.\n\nIf an integer $d$ is a divisor of $n$, it is included in the list.\nIf it does not full divide $n$, it is discarded.\n\n[Back to top](#)\n\n---\n\n## Checking if an integer is

Language: Clean\n\nname param\n| guardA\n    | guardAA = exprAA\n```\n\n### Guarded Expression Rules\n\nGuarded expressions of a function implementation must follow certain rules.\nViolation of such rules results in a compile-time error.\n\nSee [Guarded Expression Rules](function/Guarded%20Expression%20Rules.md).\n\n---\n\n## Selecting a Guarded Expression To Be Evaluated\n\n*Guarded expressions are tried in descending order, and the expression of the first guard yield true is evaluated.*\n\nTo demonstrate, let's define a function called `signum`.\nIt accepts one integer value as argument, and returns the sign.\n\n`signum` can be defined in a few ways to achieve the describe behavior.\nFor the sake of simplicity, it will be defined with one implementation which has three guarded expressions.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsignum n\n| n == 0 =  0\n| n \u003e  0 =  1\n| n \u003c  0 = -1\n```\n\nLet's call signum with -2 to investigate this rule.\n\n```\n// Language: CLean\n\nsignum  -2  // ?\n```\n\nThe first guard is tried. \n\n| Guard  # | Guard    | Expression | Result |\n| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| 1        | `n == 0` | `-2 == 0`  | Fail   |\n\nIt evaluates to false, and this guarded expression is not selected.\n\nThe next guard is tried.\n\n| Guard  # | Guard    | Expression | Result |\n| -------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| 1        | `n == 0` | `-2 == 0`  | Fail   |\n| 2        | `n \u003e  0` | `-2 \u003e  0`  | Fail   |\n\nIt evaluates to false, and this guarded expression is not selected.\n\nThe last guard is tried.\n\n| Guard # | Guard    | Expression | Result |\n| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| 1       | `n == 0` | `-2 == 0`  | Fail   |\n| 2       | `n \u003e  0` | `-2 \u003e  0`  | Fail   |\n| 3       | `n \u003c  0` | `-2 \u003c  0`  | Pass   |\n\nIt evaluates to true, this guarded expression is selected.\n\nThe result is obtained from the expression associated with the third guard, which is -1.\n\n```\n// Language:\n\nsignum -2  // -1\n```\n\n*Guarded expressions are tried only if their function implementation is selected.\nIf a function implementation is not selected, guarded expressions, which belong to it, are not tried.*\n\nTo better demonstrate, an arbitrary function is defined as follows.\n\n```\n// language: Clean\n\nsomeFunction paramA\n| guardAA = expressionAA\n| guardAB = expressionAB\nsomeFunction paramB\n| guardBA = expressionBA\n| guardBB = expressionBB\n```\n\nIn cases where the second implementation is selected, `guardAA` and `guardAB` are skipped.\n\n*Once a function implementation is selected, subsequent implementations are not tried, even if no guarded expression can be selected.*\n\nTo demonstrate, let's modify the definition of `superSafeDivide` and call the definition `superSafeDivideAlt` to avoid confusion.\n\n\n```\nsuperSafeDivide n 0\n| n == 0            = 0\nsuperSafeDivide n m = n / m\n```\n\nThe main difference is `superSafeDivideAlt` no longer explicitly terminates the program.\n\nThe behavior of both function remains similar, but a problem occurs when `superSafeDivideAlt` is called with a non-zero integer and 0.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsuperSafeDivideAlt 9 0  // ?\n```\n\nThe first implementation is tried.\n\n| Pair # | Parameter | Argument | Result |\n| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 1      | `n`       | `9`      | Pass   |\n| 2      | `0`       | `0`      | Pass   |\n\nIt is selected, and it first guard is tried.\n\n| Guard # | Guard    | Expression | Result |\n| ------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |\n| 1       | `n == 0` | `9 == 0`   | Fail   |\n\nThe first guard is not selected.\n\n\nIn such a case, the function definition is partial, and the function call results in a run-time error.","lastmodified":"2023-06-19T20:30:36.495859819Z","tags":null},"/function/Implementation-Rules":{"title":"Implementation Rules","content":"\nWhen defining a function, its

error.\n\nSee [Implementation Rules](function/Implementation%20Rules.md).\n\n### Extending the Expression of a Function Implementation\n\nOn its own, a function implementation has one expression associated with it.\nThe function implementation has ownership over its expression.\n\nBy introducing guarded expressions, an implementation can have ownership over multiple guarded expressions, instead of just one expression.\n\nSee [Guarded Expressions](function/Guarded%20Expressions.md).\n\n---\n\n## Selecting an Implementation To Be Evaluated\n\nA function definition often contains multiple function implementations.\nOnly one implementation can be selected.\n\n*Implementations are tried in descending order, and the first implementation, whose parameters match with every argument, is selected.*\n\nLet's describe `safeDivide` as a function which:\n- accepts two integers as arguments, \n- returns the result of division, and\n- returns zero when the given denominator is 0.\n\n```\n// Langauge: Clean\n\nsafeDivide 6 2  // 3\nsafeDivide 2 0  // 0\n```\n\nIt can be defined using two implementations.\n\n```\n// Langauge: Clean\n\nsafeDivide m 0 = 0\nsafeDivide m n = m / n\n```\n\nLet's call `safeDivide` with 9 and 6 and investigate.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsafeDivide 9 6  // ?\n```\n\nApply the rule to see which implementation is selected.\n\nThe first implementation is tried, and the first parameter matches the first argument.\n\n| Pair # | Parameter | Argument | Result |\n| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 1      | `m`       | `9`      | Pass   |\n\nThe second parameter does not match the second argument.\n\n| Pair # | Parameter | Argument | Result |\n| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 1      | `m`       | `9`      | Pass   |\n| 2      | `0`       | `6`      | Fail   |\n\nThe first implementation is not selected.\n\nNext, the second implementation is tried, and both parameters match both arguments.\n\n| Pair # | Parameter | Argument | Result |\n| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 1      | `m`       | `9`      | Pass   |\n| 2      | `n`       | `6`      | Pass   |\n\nThe second implementation is selected.\n\nThe result is obtained from the expression of the second implementation, which is `m / n`.\nIt evaluates to 1.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsafeDivide 9 6  // 1\n```\n\nLet's call `safeDivide` with 9 and 0 instead.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsafeDivide 9 0\n```\n\nThe first implementation is tried, and the first parameter matches the first argument.\n\n| Pair # | Parameter | Argument | Result |\n| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 1      | `m`       | `9`      | Pass   |\n\nThe second parameter matches the second argument.\n\n| Pair # | Parameter | Argument | Result |\n| ------ | --------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 1      | `m`       | `9`      | Pass   |\n| 2      | `0`       | `0`      | Pass   |\n\nThe first implementation is select, and the second implementation is not tried.\n\nThe result is obtained from the expression of the first implementation, which is 0.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsafeDivide 9 0  // 0\n```\n\nNotice that if implementation order is changed, `safeDivide` would have unintended behaviors.\n\nTo demonstrate, the implementation order of `safeDivide` is changed.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsafeDivide m n = m / n\nsafeDivide m 0 = 0\n```\n\nThe second implementation is never reached even if `safeDivide`  is called with `0`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nsafeDivide 9 0  // Uh oh\n```\n\nMore importantly, this rule does not perform equality operation.\n\n### No Valid Candidate for Selection\n\nIf none of the implementation is a valid candidate for selection, the function call results in a run-time error.\n\nSee [Partial Functions](function/Partial%20Functions.md).","lastmodified":"2023-06-19T20:30:36.495859819Z","tags":null},"/function/Partial-Functions":{"title":"Partial

assumption that it works with  `-1` as well.\n\n```\nisOne -1  // True\n```\n\nLet's call `isOne` with zero.\n\n```\nisOne 0\n```\n\nThe first implementation is tried.\nThe first parameter does not

function call results in a run-time error.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisOne 0  // Uh oh\n```\n\nWe can conclude that `isOne` is a partial function, because it results in a run-time error when called with values outside of its domain.\n\n---\n\n## Partial Function by Guarded Expression\n\nAlternatively, `isOne` can be define with one implementation which has two guarded expressions.\n\n```\nisOne n\n| n == (-1) = True\n| n ==   1  = True\n```\n\nLet's try calling it with negative one and follow the [Guarded Expression Signature Rule](function/Guarded%20Expression%20Rules.md#Guarded%20Expression%20Signature%20Rule) to make sure that works.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisOne -1\n```\n\nThe first implementation is tried.\nThe

result of the function call is obtained from the expression associated with the first guard, which is `True`.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisOne (-1)  // True\n```\n\nThe same problem arises when called with zero, because this definition of `isOne` is still partial.\n\n---\n\n## Resolving Partial Functions\n\nThere are many ways to completely define a function.\n\nA good way is to change the method in which the function is define.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisOne n = n == (-1) || n == 1\n```\n\nThis way, the semantic meaning of the function is preserved.\n\nAdding addition implementations to cover the possible domain of input is also a good way to complete a function.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisOne (-1) = True\nisOne   1  = True\nisOne   n  = False\n```\n\nThis definition ensures that the `isOne` will never result in a run-time error by implementing an addition \"catch all\" implementation.\n\nFinally, A built-in function called `abort` helps complete a function by terminating the program early.\n\n```\n// Language: Clean\n\nisOne (-1) = True\nisOne   1  = True\nisOne   n  = abort \"isOne called with values outside of domain.\"\n```\n\nSee
