# Cleanpedia

## Preface

Welcome to this collection of notes and examples on CLEAN. 
This compilation serves as a personal reference that I have created to document and future-proofing my knowledge.

To accomplish that, each topic provides examples, code snippets, and comments.

## Introduction

This reference 
The same information can be found on:

- [Cloogle](https://cloogle.org/) which is the language’s search engine, and
- [language report](https://cloogle.org/doc/) which describes the syntax and BNF of Clean.

However, this documentation is not official.
Terminologies and explanations may not be entirely true to the references used.

In addition, the language report, which was the primary source of this documentation, was written for the version 2.0 of CLEAN.
